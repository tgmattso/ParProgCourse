These code in this directory supports a hands-on OpenCL tutorial.  
With such a diversity of OpenCL platforms, there can be issues as
you port this code form one platform to the next.  Most issues
are dealt with in the file that sets macros used inside the makefile.
These are set in the make.def file.  Other issues, however, are 
exposed inside the source code.

Common problems:

The C code and the OpenCL kernel code need to know the types used in 
these programs.  Hence, we have no choice but to encode this type in
two places.   That means you can have a mismatch between C and the
OpenCL code.  Make sure the type (set by the macro TYPE) is the same
in mm_utils.h and the ".cl" files you are using.

Some GPUs do not support double.  For example, the GEN GPU integrated
with an Intel CPU often only supports float.  Since we don't test if
double is supported in the kernel code, if you try to go with double
the numerics will be all screwed up and you'll get results with lots
of NANs.

The Apple implementation of OpenCL stupidly limits the local 
work-group size on a CPU to be one. This is insane, but they won't 
change.  We don't test this in tutorial code since we need things to 
be as uncluttered as possible.  So make sure the WGSIZE parameter 
in your host code is set to 1 when you are running on a CPU under OSX.
