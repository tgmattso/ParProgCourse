This repository holds the materials for an interactive parallel programming course.   For the
full course, we start with a brief lecture on parallel computing in general.  The we cover
parallel programming in detail using OpenMP.  After a full day of OpenMP, we close 
with a quick lecture that covers other parallel programming models (MPI and OpenCL/CUDA).

Note the LICENSE file.  Anyone can grab this content and do whatever you want with it.

The OpenMP exercises are found in the directory:

       OMP_Exercises
       
Inside this directory there is a file where all macros used by the makefiles are defined.  Its called:

        make.def
        
 The directory Make_def_files holds a number of example make.def files should you get stuck and 
 need help.
 
 As we said earlier, the exercises for the hands-on OpenMP tutorial are in the OMP_Exercises
 directory.  Inside that directory is a directory holding the solutions to the exercises:
 
 
        solutions
        
They are there for your own self-study, but if you are taking one of my tutorials on parallel programming,
do not look at the solutions.  Looking up the answers in advance will diminish your learning experience.

We also have a set of extra problems you can work with for more advanced study.  they are found in
the directory:

       challenge_problems
       
 For each problem, we have a solutions directory as well. 
 
 Finally, the learning in the course uses the C programming language.  If you do not know C, we have a 
 file that covers everything you need to know in order to complete the exercises.
 
        learningC.c
